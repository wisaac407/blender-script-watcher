# Script Watcher - Reload script upon changes.

A development tool used for creating [blender][1] scripts.

## What it does
Script Watcher is a [blender][1] addon used to assist in developing other scripts. It does this by watching python scripts for
changes, whenever you make a change to the watched script, it will be re-run. This useful for developing blender scripts outside
of blender (i.e. not directly in blenders text editor).

## Installation:
Download the file `script_watcher.py` then open blender, go to user settings(`Ctrl-Alt-U`) and select `Install from file`.
Find the file previously downloaded and click `install`.

## Additional Notes:
This script is considered to be a bata version. If you find any bugs please fill out a [bug report][2]
